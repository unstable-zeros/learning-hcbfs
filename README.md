Code needed to replicate the examples from "Learning Hybrid Control Barrier Functions from Data" by L. Lindemann et al., to appear at CoRL 2020.  See [here](https://github.com/unstable-zeros/learning-hcbfs/blob/main/CoRL_15min.mp4) for a short 15min video about our work!

Code for the bouncing ball case study can be found [here](https://github.com/unstable-zeros/learning-hcbfs/tree/main/bouncing_ball_for_share)

Code for the compass gait case study will be posted soon!
